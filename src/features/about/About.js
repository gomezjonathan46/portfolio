        I began my career in Finance with a prestigious Private Equity firm in
        Philadelphia. However, I discovered my passion for technology too
        invigorating and empowering to ignore. With more than 5 billion
        estimated global internet users, there are phenomenal creative
        opportunities and a great demand for web developers. My transition into
        this field began with teaching myself the fundamentals of computer
        programming. I was determined and learned Python, which lead to my
        acceptance into Google's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program,
        where I honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With years of
        experience, I now employ my passion for technology using modern day
        solutions, such as React, to increase efficiencies and provide digital
        solutions to today's problems.
